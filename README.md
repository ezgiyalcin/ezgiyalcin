Hi there! I'm a geology engineer based in Kaş, Antalya, and I'm currently focusing on developing my career in the software industry. I have experience in sales management in the fair sector and currently own a Cafe&Bar&Store in Kaş. Also I'm a scuba diving instructor as well. 

I'm learning front-end and React technologies for software development.

My Github profile showcases my front-end development projects, which use HTML, CSS for now. I will also learn to use JavaScript, React, Bootstrap etc. for designing and will improve the user experience.

I have few mini-projects that showcase my skills in using different technologies and concepts.

I prioritize creating well-designed and well-structured code that is easy to read and maintain.

Feel free to check out my Github profile for more information and to reach out to me with any feedback or inquiries.

Thank you!
