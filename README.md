👋Hi there! I have a Bachelor's Degree on Geological Engineering, living in Kaş, Antalya,Turkey. I have experience in sales management in exhibition sector and currently own a Cafe&Bar&Store in Kaş. Also I'm a scuba diving instructor as well.

Now I'm currently focusing on developing my career in the software industry.

👀I'm learning front-end and React technologies for software development.

👨🏼‍💻My Github profile showcases my front-end development projects, which use HTML, CSS for now. I will also learn to use JavaScript, React, Bootstrap etc. for designing and will improve the user experience.

👨🏼‍💻I have few mini-projects that showcase my skills in using different technologies and concepts.

👨🏼‍💻I prioritize creating well-designed and well-structured code that is easy to read and maintain.

👀Feel free to check out my Github profile for more information and to reach out to me with any feedback or inquiries.

Thank you!
